    "Classical SIR/SIRD models treat “infection” as a single compartment and ignore important stages such as incubation, severe illness, and temporary immunity. That makes them mathematically convenient, but biologically imprecise. Incubation delays transmission, bedridden patients have fewer contacts, and recovery often confers short-term immunity rather than permanent protection. In this project, the SIRD framework model is extended to a multi-stage model that tracks individuals through six health states: Healthy (H), Incubating (I), Contagious (C), Bed-ridden (B), Immune/Recovered (M), and Dead (D). At the population level, these states can be described by a system of coupled differential equations with parameters controlling infection, progression, recovery, and death rates. To capture individual variability and contact structure, our group implements these dynamics as an agent-based simulation on a contact network. Each person is a finite state machine (FSM) that moves between H, I, C, B, M, and D according to probabilistic rules calibrated to match target incubation times, contagious periods, and case fatality rates. Together, the compartmental model and network-based FSM provide a flexible tool for exploring how disease severity, contact patterns, and bed-rest policies shape outbreak trajectories."
