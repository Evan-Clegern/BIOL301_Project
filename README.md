Task list for project

## Base Roadmap
1. Finish desigining the core parameters for simulation purposes
2. Finish implementing state handlers for each main state type
3. Implement infection exposure and fatality mechanics
4. Test SimIndividual for general functionality
5. Begin implementing a connection graph between nodes
6. Stress-test and optimize structures
7. Test diseases and tweak as needed

## More Specific Tasks
* ( ) Review and finish clarifying documentation for simulation parameters.
* ( ) Review and finish describing the base mathematical models for the SimIndividual.
* ( ) Implement the rest of the CONTAGIOUS state's core logic.
* ( ) Implement the BEDRIDDEN state's core logic.
* ( ) Implement any additional unique logic for RECOVERED or DECEASED individuals.
* ( ) Complete the 'sub-day' update logic function, including scheduling of state changes.
* ( ) Implement infection exposure methods.
* ( ) Test a few SimIndividuals on a small scale.
